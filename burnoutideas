Hi. I'll start posting my "ideas". You don't need to care and I don't expect you to. After all in gamedev everyone prefers their 
own ideas. Also they actually aren't ideas at all and also they're incomplete. The thing is, I actually always wanted to make a 
game like Gothic, that's why I stated gamedev originally. 

I know a really good writer but that's about it, I learned how to mostly everything for this job but not properly, and I also
don't have 20 years of time. Besides I never really figured out if I wanted to make this single- or multiplayer, then again 
that's not so important, the core mechanics would be the same anyway. But as my username gives away I am burnt out so I'll 
probably never do any of this now.

I would intentionally make this look like the original gothic with no special filters etc.

Sometimes I also contemplate going further back in time to make a text group rpg. Or to make an online game that features 
submarines, like the very old game "subculture" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGB_K7BCCyc < it was pretty cool and could work
as a smaller agar.io style multiplayer game or as an mmo with missions.

Running out of energy now to even write about this.

Can anyone here into character modelling and animation? cause if I had a character, I could make the items, world, trees, 
and perhaps code by myself and run a donations campaign with some hype.
