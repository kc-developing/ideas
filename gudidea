Alright lads.

We should do a 2d platformer in C/SDL (because that's all I know). It should be riddled with kcmemes and has to have a decent gameplay. We could ask bernds for sprites, music etc, or we could just use some public domain media stuff.

I'm definitely not doing it alone though. Need at least 1 more bernd.
